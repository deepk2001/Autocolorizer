# Autocolorizer
Looking at a grayscale picture as input, this project attacks the problem of hallucinating an appreciable color version of a picture. This problem is clearly unrelated, so previous approaches have either relied on significant user interactions or resulting in desaturated colorifications. We propose a fully automated approach that produces vibrant and realistic colors. We acknowledge the inherent uncertainty of the problem by presenting it as a classification task and use class-rebalancing over training time to increase the variability of colors in the results. We also point out that by acting as a cross channel encoder, colorization can be a powerful excuse for self-supervised feature learning. This approach is the result of state-of-the-art performance on several feature learning benchmarks.
